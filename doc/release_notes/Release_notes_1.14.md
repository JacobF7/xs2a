# Release notes v. 1.14

## Supported payment creation with pain.001 XML message
Now, an endpoint POST /v1/payments/{payment-product} supports creation of a single payment in pain.001 format. 
A TPP needs to provide body in pain.001 XML format and provide a required payment-product(pain.001-sepa-credit-transfers, etc). 
GET /v1/payments/{payment-id} endpoint was updated as well to support a single payment in pain.001 format and returns the whole XML body of it.
